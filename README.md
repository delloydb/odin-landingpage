*Replace with an actual screenshot of your finished page.*

This is a solution to the **Landing Page** project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. The goal was to replicate a given design image using HTML and CSS, following precise specifications for colors, fonts, and layout.

## ✨ Overview

The page presents a classic marketing-style layout: a header with navigation, a hero section with a call‑to‑action, an information grid, a testimonial quote, a sign‑up banner, and a footer. The design is fully responsive and uses only HTML and CSS.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Pixel‑perfect implementation** – matches the provided design image and style guide.
- ✅ **Responsive layout** – adapts gracefully to different screen sizes using Flexbox.
- ✅ **Clean typography** – Google Fonts “Roboto” in exact weights and sizes as specified.
- ✅ **Consistent color scheme** – follows the exact hex codes from the spec.

## 🛠 Built With

- **HTML5** – semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, custom properties, responsive design

## 📸 What I Learned

- How to translate a static design (image + style guide) into a living web page.
- Using **CSS Flexbox** to create complex, responsive layouts without hassle.
- The importance of a **design system** (consistent spacing, fonts, colors) and implementing it with precision.
- Structuring HTML to be both readable and flexible for styling.
